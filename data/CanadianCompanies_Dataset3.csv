The incumbent will need to keep abreast of trends and innovations in the university library environment in terms of student experience.
A key challenge of this position is to meet the diverse and far-reaching information needs of library users. The incumbent will need to adapt to the type of question being asked: directional, technical, basic reference, the location of a document in the collection, how to access electronic resources, etc. While many of these questions have already been answered (e.g. FAQ), the position holder will also need to know when to refer more complex or specialized questions to librarians.

The incumbent must possess and maintain extensive and changing knowledge of various library resources such as database platforms, new versions of operating systems, new computing devices, etc.
Another challenge is to ensure quality service and follow-up, demonstrating great tact and attention to detail, since the success of projects depends on rigorous, detailed organization. This may include direct or functional supervision of regular employees and/or students.
The incumbent must communicate tactfully and diplomatically with users, including donors. The different clienteles, sometimes demanding and/or in distress, increase the customer service challenges to be offered.

   10. Working conditions and environment
 

   Physical effort: Moderate
   The incumbent sits in front of a computer at the information desk and at his/her desk, but must also make a physical effort, as he/she is constantly on the move within the department. The work is performed in an open area, so the incumbent must constantly maintain a professional posture. The incumbent is called upon to lift books weighing no more than 10 pounds.
 


   Physical environment: Medium
   The work is generally performed in a normal office environment, as well as at the information counter.
 


   Sensory Attention: Moderate
 

   The work requires good concentration in order to understand users' requests and respond effectively and appropriately.
   The work requires good listening skills in order to understand the needs of different users. The incumbent must have sustained attention where hearing is used to help users.
 


   Mental strain: Moderate
   Frequent interruptions to work or increased use of the service by users during certain periods of the academic year can cause stress in this position. The work requires good judgment and problem-solving skills. Interaction with users is very frequent, and moods or demands can increase the stress level of this position.
   The incumbent may be called upon to work evenings and/or weekends, considering the library's opening hours. In addition, the incumbent may be required to work in another Library location.

Position: Copywriter
 Department: Creative
 Reports To: Creative Director
 POSITION SUMMARY:
 Copywriters don’t get enough credit. Just because someone can write an email, clickbait article, social caption, or even a 3000-word political science essay, doesn’t make them a Copywriter.
 Copywriters are creative conceptors. Strategic thinkers. Grammatical wizards. And empathetic wordsmiths. They don’t simply write. They masterfully transform everyday, boring words into attention-getting, creatively-emotive messages—whether it’s a 7-word headline on a billboard, a poetic manifesto in a 30-second video, or a 125-character Facebook post.
 That’s exactly what Canucks Sports & Entertainment is looking for. As our Copywriter, you’ll be the voice of the most renowned and envied brand in the lower mainland—the Vancouver Canucks. You’ll also concept and write for the Abbotsford Canucks, Vancouver Warriors, and Rogers Arena across integrated media, such as video, social, emails, OOH, in-arena and more.
 But like the beginning of this job posting implies, we’re not just looking for someone who can write. We’re looking for someone who can craft headlines that other writers will pin on their Pinterest page, bookmark in their browser, and dogear in a Communication Arts Annual.
 This role will focus on:

Collaborating, concepting, and writing for all Canucks Sports & Entertainment brands
Elevating the creativity of our marketing communications to be the NHL’s best in class
Other duties may be assigned as required



 WE HAVE:

A team you can belong to and believe in
A fun, high energy environment
An open mind for new ideas
The opportunity to embark on a career development journey



 YOU HAVE:

At least 2 years of advertising copywriting experience—ad agency or in-house creative preferred
A portfolio that demonstrates creative concepting and headline writing skills
Strong command of grammar and English language
Excellent attention to detail



 YOU MAY ALSO HAVE:

A strong understanding of NHL hockey and professional sports



 PLEASE NOTE:

This role will work on-location in our downtown Vancouver office at Rogers Arena
Candidates are required to submit a portfolio of work with their application. Only those with a portfolio will be considered.



 Vancouver is one of the most diverse cities in the world and Canucks Sports & Entertainment strives to create a workforce that is inclusive, equitable, and represents our beautiful, unique community.

   The Department of Materials Engineering at the Vancouver campus (Hydrometallurgy group) is looking for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to work on a 12-month project on prediction and management of the long-term environmental risk of mine waste rock piles via 5G-enabled instrumentation and monitoring.
 


   Large quantities of mine waste are generated after valuable metals are extracted. Upon exposure to air and water, a diverse range of metals and metalloids are released and mobilized to the surrounding environment. The release process involves complex multiphase fluid transport, heat transport, geochemical reactions, and microbial activities. There is an urgent need to manage the environmental risk posed by mine waste rock piles given the spatial and temporal scale of the problem. A major bottleneck is the lack of data on waste rock pile properties. The main objective of this research is to understand how to best use 5G-enabled wireless sensor networks to monitor key characteristics such as moisture, oxygen content, and temperature of mine waste rock piles, and to use machine learning (ML) to predict drainage quantity and quality. This position will involve the following:
 

 Design and build a laboratory-scale, fully instrumented waste rock pile to demonstrate the application of 5G-enabled sensor networks to monitor key characteristics of waste rock piles.
 Use ML approach and the data collected to predict waste rock drainage properties.
 Help with the supervision of two PhD students assisting with the project.
 Participate in monthly project review meetings with the sponsor.
 The publication of the research findings is a strong objective of this postdoctoral position.


   We highly value the following skills and knowledge for this position:
 

 The candidate is required to have completed their PhD in the last five years and have strong knowledge in areas such as transport through porous media, geochemistry, reaction kinetics, and laboratory skills.
 A candidate with expertise in or willingness to learn data analytics and ML is preferred. Language experience with C, C++, Python, R is a significant plus. A PhD student will assist the candidate with work in ML.
 The candidate will have good communication and interpersonal skills, which will be required to interact with the project sponsor and interactions with technical staff at mine sites.


   The successful candidate will be supervised by Drs. Wenying Liu and Roger Beckie, in collaboration with UBC BRIMM
