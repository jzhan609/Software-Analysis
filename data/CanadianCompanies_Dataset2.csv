Working collaboratively is also critical for this position.

 Experience in researching and analyzing the impact of policy, regulatory, and legislative proposals and working with others to draw inputs from a wide range of sources.
 Ability to operate independently in representing the Canadian Chamber and its members to government officials and a range of external stakeholders.
 Familiarity in engaging with members or clients to understand their concerns on policy issues.
 No lobbying limitations at the federal level.
 Ability to work in both official languages is an asset.

 Build relationships with key political staff and civil servants to advance policy objectives and gain insights on policy, legislative and regulatory developments.
 Identify and leverage opportunities for senior Chamber staff to support delivery of advocacy work.
 Manage and support member policy committee(s). Ensure that member contact lists for committees are maintained and up to date.
 Work closely with the rest of the policy team to ensure the Canadian Chamber maintains consistency on the positions taken with respect to international and domestic issues.

 The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!

 “Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are calling for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.

 Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of billions of dollars safe every single day.

 What Are We Looking For? We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models, and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything, a passion for getting things done right and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.

 To be a Senior Manager in Retail Models & Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer; you also need to be a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal stakeholders across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy datasets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.

 Make an Impact As a Senior Manager, you will report directly to a Director and be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – models covering the Bank’s retail unsecured product lines across the credit risk lifecycle that contributes to the Bank’s profitability targets and management of credit risk. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners which may include Capital, Provisioning, Model Operations, Enterprise Stress Testing, Product, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Compliance and Audit.

 You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on-premise GPU computing, open source Jupyter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.

 Under the guidance of your Director, you will use these tools to develop advanced risk predictive models that will be used to make decisions worth billions of dollars every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals and priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.

 Is This Role Right for You?

 You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way
 You are both deeply curious and highly pragmatic
 You are comfortable with ambitious but realistic goals and are committed to achieving them
 You are social, engaging, not afraid to ask questions and relish the opportunity to learn from global partners across the firm (who may be less technical than you)
 You relish the opportunity and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that the output of your models will directly influence the bank’s financial statements or decisions that impacts a real human being
 You have a genuine love, passion and talent for programming, data, and predictive modeling
 You are committed to quality in everything you do – statistically, process and governance wise
 You look forward to sharing your insights through high-quality verbal & written communications

   About BlackBerry
 

   Today, BlackBerry is a transformed company. What we once did for smartphones we’re now doing for financial institutions, automotive OEMs, aerospace, defense, healthcare, and media companies: envisioning, enabling, and securing new forms of communication that are connecting the world in extraordinary new ways. We have the most sophisticated end-to-end solutions, and our ideas lead the way in the hottest markets like cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles. With such growth and opportunity, you couldn’t consider joining us at a more exciting time!
 


   Are you the person we're looking for?
 

   Are you fascinated by cloud-native technologies? Do you feel a nagging disquiet when you see something that isn't automated well, or worse, not at all? Are you intrigued by the challenges presented by running globally distributed, multi-cloud infrastructure that enterprises and governments around the world depend on?
 

   As a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) on the BlackBerry Service Engineering & Operations team, you'll be responsible for keeping BlackBerry services running smoothly and securely, with the availability that our customers expect. You'll do this by blending operational discipline with systems engineering principles, emphasizing robust automation and rigorous observability.
 

   The kind of SRE we want is comfortable with Kubernetes and containers, particularly in public clouds such as AWS and Azure. You're no stranger to Git workflows and GitOps practices. Need that merge request rebased? No problem. GitLab pipeline failing? You've got it covered. You've used Terraform enough to know how to navigate its idiosyncrasies. You're able to wrangle PromQL to build the perfect Grafana dashboards to monitor your services and craft high-quality, actionable alerts. You might even enjoy spending your free time going for long walks on the beach while thinking about all the ways complex systems can fail - who are we to judge!
 

   Toil is your enemy. You consider it a good day when you can fire up Vim and whip up a Bash or Python script to automate an annoying task you do regularly. VS Code? That works too, we're equal opportunity at BlackBerry. (Unless you use Emacs, of course.) Polyglot? Even better. We've also got tools written in Go, Ruby, and even C++.
 

   A broader knowledge of programming languages and software development practices is a strong asset that helps you build and manage world-class services and makes you a better partner to BlackBerry's various development teams, which as an SRE is a fundamental aspect of your job. Software architects, developers, and product owners will look to you for your infrastructure and operational insights that will shape the solutions our customers use every day.
 

   If this sounds like you, come join our team of SREs and help us solve interesting and challenging problems!
 


   Responsibilities
 

 Partner with product development teams to design, build and maintain secure, highly available cloud-based services
 Support deeply integrated and sophisticated CI/CD pipelines
 Ensure the services you support have essential metrics, high quality dashboards and alerts, with well-documented runbooks
 Maintain existing services by measuring overall system health and ensuring platforms and related software are current and patched
 Be a member of an on-call rotation (includes additional compensation) in a global 24x7 environment, responding to escalations, performing root cause analyses, and striving to ensure the same incident never occurs twice
 Help maintain our catalog of reusable, cross-service automation and build custom automation as needed for your services
 Find inventive ways of reducing costs and improving the performance of existing systems
 Plan for infrastructure and services to meet targeted SLOs and capacity
 Document as much as possible, and automate everything else



   Skills and Qualifications
 

 Post-secondary degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline, or equivalent practical experience
 5+ years of experience working with cloud technologies, systems administration, or related fields in a production environment
 Extremely comfortable using Linux and navigating around the shell
 Experience with public clouds such as AWS, Azure, or GCP
 Experience with private clouds such as OpenStack or OpenNebula would be an asset
 Strong familiarity with Git and associated Git workflows
 Experience automating infrastructure deployments using tools like Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc.
 Sound knowledge of observability principles and experience using solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, or related SaaS
 Experience using container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
 Solid understanding of the full infrastructure stack: networks and network protocols, block and object storage, virtualization and operating systems, traffic steering (especially load balancers and DNS), and databases
 Experience with CI/CD pipelines using solutions such as GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins
 Competent and preferably fluent in at least one programming language (Bash counts, but something like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, or Go is preferred)



   Projects you could be part of
 

 Plan, design and migrate globally deployed services from private to public clouds.
 Improve and build upon our existing observability platform by researching and prototyping new monitoring, logging or tracing technologies.
 Partner with a product development team to help bring new secure and resilient services from idea to production.
 Work with a task force team to help improve the performance and availability of business critical service deployments.
 Become part of a DevOps group to build custom solutions, establish deployment patterns and help standardize operational practices.
